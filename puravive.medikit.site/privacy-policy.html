<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">Personal data is information that identifies you, such as your name, e-mail or postal addresses. Puravive does not collect personal data from you except when you specifically provide such data (e.g. when subscribing to e-mail newsletters, taking part in a survey, competition or sweepstake, ordering samples or brochures, or requesting for information) and consent to its use.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">We store, use, or transfer your personal data only accordingly to your consent and to the extent – with respect to content and time – needed in each specific case, e.g. to respond to your questions or concerns, to fulfill your requests or to inform you about the results of a competition or order to do this, it may be necessary for Puravive to transfer personal data to other companies within the worldwide Puravive group or to external service providers for further data processing. Service providers may, for example, be commissioned in the context of shipping goods, distributing advertising material or in the scope of competitions. Puravive requires that these parties agree to process personal data based on our instructions and in compliance with this data protection notice. Any other transfer of your personal data, for example the transfer of logon data from our websites to a third party’s social community website or web service like Facebook or Twitter, requires your explicit prior consent. Puravive guarantees that it will not sell or lease your personal data to a third party. We may, however, have to disclose information about you if we are required to do so by law or in response to enforceable governmental requests.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">PROTECTION OF YOUR DATA WHEN ORDERING AND PAYING IN THE ONLINE SHOP</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you order products in webshop either as a guest or a registered user, your personal data will only be transmitted in encrypted form. The payment processing is also in line with the highest security requirements. All data is transmitted encrypted, and is thereby protected from unauthorised access by third parties. Your credit and debit card data will, moreover, be processed and stored in accordance with the most stringent security requirements in the credit card industry, i.e. the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (abbreviated to “PCI DSS”), by the certified Payment Service Provider ConCardis GmbH (with registered office in Germany).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have decided on PayPal or immediate bank transfer as your method of payment, you declare that you are in agreement with your order data being gathered by PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. (with registered office in Luxembourg) or by Sofort AG, (with registered office in Germany) and processed for the purpose of handling the payment processing. The data privacy statements of the respective payment service providers shall apply.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have decided on giropay as your method of payment, you declare that you are in agreement that the IBAN and BIC data entered by you is transmitted to giropay GmbH (with registered office in Germany) in encrypted form for the purpose of handling the payment processing. The data transmitted will then be processed by giropay GmbH for this purpose. In such a case, the data privacy statement of the payment service provider shall also apply.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">LIMITED PASSING ON OF DATA</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">When processing your request, it may be necessary for Puravive to pass on your personal data to other affiliated companies within the Puravive Group or an external service provider, also in respective European countries outside the EU, that exclusively act on our behalf. Such service providers may, for example, be commissioned with sending you product samples, distributing promotional materials or handling competitions or your order placed at our webshop, e.g. the shipping of the goods. Puravive requires all affiliated companies within the Puravive Group and its external service providers to keep your personal data exclusively in line with our specifications, and in compliance with this data privacy statement, as well as the statutory requirements on order data processing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, if you make an appointment with Haus on our website, we will transmit your data that is required for that purpose to our 100% subsidiary, Puravive Hautpflege GmbH, which operates Haus, in accordance with the standards of this data privacy statement and the corresponding statutory regulations. Your data will only be saved and used for the purpose of your appointment.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">Otherwise, we neither pass on personal data to third parties without your permission nor do we sell or lease data. We do, however, reserve the right to disclose information about you if we are legally obliged to do so or if we are requested to hand it over by legitimately acting authorities or criminal prosecution institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">DATA SECURITY</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">We have adopted technical and organisational measures to protect your data from being lost, changed or accessed by a third party. The security procedures we use are regularly enhanced to reflect technological progress.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div>
